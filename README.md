# Task-Completion-Prediction

Project Overview:
A management consultant is analyzing the factors that influence whether system administrators complete assigned tasks within a set timeframe. Data were collected on 575 administrators, including their experience, training credits, and team assignment.

Objective:
Use logistic regression to predict whether new system administrators will successfully complete tasks based on experience and training data. The model supports staff management and hiring decisions by identifying performance drivers.

Context:
The dataset (SystemAdministrators_v2.csv) includes variables for months of experience, number of training credits, team (A or B), and task completion outcome (1 = Yes, 0 = No). A separate file (new_sys_admin.csv) provides information on three new administrators for prediction.

Key Steps:
Data cleaning and exploration
Model training using logistic regression
Evaluation through confusion matrix and ROC analysis
Prediction of outcomes for new administrators

Outcome:
A predictive framework for assessing task completion likelihood among system administrators, enabling data-driven workforce planning and performance management.
